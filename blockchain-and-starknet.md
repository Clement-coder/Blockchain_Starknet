# Blockchain and StarkNet

## Introduction

Blockchain is one of the most important technologies in the world today. It is used in cryptocurrency finance gaming voting systems and many digital platforms. It allows people to send value and data without using banks or middlemen. StarkNet is part of this new technology. It helps blockchain work faster and cheaper.

## What Is a Blockchain

A blockchain is a digital record system. It stores information in blocks. Each block contains data. Each block is linked to the one before it. This creates a chain of blocks. The data stored cannot be changed easily. The blockchain is shared across many computers. These computers are called nodes. Every node keeps a copy of the blockchain. This makes the system safe and open.

No single person controls the blockchain. Decisions are made by the network. This is why blockchain is called decentralized.

## How Blockchain Works

A user creates a transaction. The transaction is sent to the network. The network checks if the transaction is valid. This is done by many computers. If it is valid it is added to a block. The block is then added to the blockchain. Every computer updates its copy.

Once a block is added it becomes permanent. It cannot be changed easily. This is what makes blockchain secure and trusted.

## Why Blockchain Is Trusted

Blockchain does not need trust between users. Trust is placed in the system. The records are open to everyone. Anyone can verify a transaction. Cryptography is used to protect the data. This makes hacking very difficult. This is why blockchain is used for money and data.

## Uses of Blockchain

Blockchain is used in cryptocurrency like Bitcoin and Ethereum. It is used in banking and payments. It is used in supply chain tracking. It is used in voting systems. It is used in gaming and digital identity. Many companies now use blockchain in their systems.

## What Is StarkNet

StarkNet is a Layer 2 blockchain built on Ethereum. It helps Ethereum handle more transactions. It makes transactions faster. It makes transactions cheaper. It does this by moving most work off the main Ethereum chain.

StarkNet uses a technology called zero knowledge proofs. The specific proof it uses is called STARK. This allows many transactions to be grouped together and verified as one. This reduces cost and increases speed.

## The Cairo Language

Smart contracts on StarkNet are written in a language called Cairo. Cairo is designed for building secure and scalable contracts. It is different from Solidity which is used on Ethereum. Cairo is made to work well with zero knowledge proofs.

## Why StarkNet Is Important

Ethereum is powerful but expensive and slow at times. StarkNet solves this problem. It reduces gas fees. It increases speed. It keeps security strong because it is connected to Ethereum. It allows developers to build better applications. It supports finance games NFTs and many other projects.

## Difference Between Ethereum and StarkNet

Ethereum is the main Layer 1 chain. StarkNet is a Layer 2 built on top of Ethereum. Ethereum handles security. StarkNet handles speed and low cost. They work together to make blockchain better.

## Conclusion

Blockchain is a digital system that stores data in a secure and decentralized way. It removes the need for middlemen. It allows people to trust the system instead of trusting each other. StarkNet is a scaling solution built on Ethereum. It makes blockchain faster and cheaper. It helps developers build modern decentralized applications.
